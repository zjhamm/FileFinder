This is a small project that makes it easier to open files or folders in 
Sublime Text editor. Once set up, the user can open up a terminal and type in:
"mysubl <file or folder name>" and the script will recursively go through the
users home folder seraching for the given folders. Adding a --root will start
the script from the root directory (this is not the default for performance
purposes). The user can include multiple files and folders at once. 

The shell script simply compiles the c++ code and runs it.
