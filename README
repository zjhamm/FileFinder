-------------------------------------------- MAIN PROJECT --------------------------------------
This is a small project that makes it easier to open files or folders in any given program that 
can be run via the terminal. In my case I chose Sublime Text Editor, but with a few tweaks a 
user can open any file with any program.This program can also be used as a general file locator 
to locate hidden files and print the pathname out to the terminal (if tweaked a little). For my 
use case, the user can open up a terminal and type in: "mysubl <file or folder name>" and the 
script will recursively go through the users home folder seraching for the given folders or 
files. The user can include multiple files and folders to open at once. 

There is a small setup required:

	1. Open up mysubl.sh and change the pathnames to match your set up

	2. If you want to be able to run the command from anywhere you need to let linux know that 
	   this command exists. I do not remember the command from memory, but a simple google 
	   search will get you the answer you're looking for.


-------------------------------------------- NEW FEATURES --------------------------------------
8/4/2016 - File Substring Search

	A user can now type in part of the file or folder names, and the algorithm will look 
	for substrings during it's search. For example, if the user types in 'finder' the 
	algorithm will return 'FileFinder' as an option to open.

8/4/2016 - Type Specified Search

	A user can now specify if they want to only search for directories or files by adding 
	the argument -d or -f to their command. For example:

	Command: 'mysubl -d finder' - will only search for DIRECTORIES with finder in the name

	Command: 'mysubl -f finder' - will only search for FILES with finder in the name

8/2/2016 - Start Search From Root

	A user can now start their search program from the root directory (/). This is not 
	the default case for performance reasons. Files most used are generally under the 
	users HOME folder so that is why we start there. If a user wishes to start from root 
	add the argument --root. For example:

	Command: 'mysubl --root finder'


---------------------------------------------- COMMENTS -----------------------------------------
 - Possible plans: Introduce a feature to recommend files/folders that are more commonly used 
 		instead of just returning every file/folder. This could greatly improve the 
 		performace by not even needing to perform the search if common pathnames were 
 		saved in a local file. The algorithm could just read from the file and ask the 
 		user if they would like to open saved pathnames. Otherwise, run the search.

 - The shell script simply compiles the c++ code and runs it.

 - I was originally thinking that I needed to remove file extensions in order to let the user 
   open a file if they had omitted the file type. I had set up a html scraper in python to go 
   online and grab a list of file extensions, but once I finished that I realized how inefficient 
   and a waste of time it was because I could simply just find a substring of the file. I left the 
   python script there incase I may need it for a different project in the future or if any 
   third-parties are interested in seeing it.
