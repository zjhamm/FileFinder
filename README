-------------------------------- MAIN PROJECT --------------------------------
This is a small project that makes it easier to open files or folders in 
Sublime Text editor. Once set up, the user can open up a terminal and type in:
"mysubl <file or folder name>" and the script will recursively go through the
users home folder seraching for the given folders. Adding a --root will start
the script from the root directory (this is not the default for performance
purposes). The user can include multiple files and folders at once. 


-------------------------------- NEW FEATURES -------------------------------
A user can now type in part of the file or folder names, and the algorithm
will look for substrings during it's search. For example, if the user types
in 'finder' the algorithm will return 'FileFinder' as an option to open.

-------------------------------- COMMENTS -----------------------------------
The shell script simply compiles the c++ code and runs it.

I was originally thinking that I needed to remove file extensions in order to 
let the user open a file if they had omitted the file type. I had set up a
html scraper in python to go online and grab a list of file extensions,
but once I finished that I realized how inefficient and a waste of time it
was because I could simply just find a substring of the file. I left the 
python script there incase I may need it for a different project in the future
or if any third-parties are interested in seeing it.
